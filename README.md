# Traffic Server Debugging

1. Bring up nginx and Traffic Server containers:

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

2. Generate a ~15MB file to use as the request body:

    ```sh
    base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 15000000 > body.txt
    ```

3. Test against `[nginx proxy] => [trafficserver 9.1.4] => [nginx server]`:

    ```sh
    for i in {1..20}; do curl -v -d @body.txt -H "Expect:" -X PUT "http://localhost:8914/?i=$i"; done
    ```

4. Test against `[nginx proxy] => [trafficserver 9.2.0] => [nginx server]`:

    ```sh
    for i in {1..20}; do curl -v -d @body.txt -H "Expect:" -X PUT "http://localhost:8920/?i=$i"; done
    ```

5. Test against `[nginx proxy] => [trafficserver 9.2.2] => [nginx server]`:

    ```sh
    for i in {1..20}; do curl -v -d @body.txt -H "Expect:" -X PUT "http://localhost:8922/?i=$i"; done
    ```

6. Test against `[nginx proxy] => [trafficserver 9.2.3] => [nginx server]`:

    ```sh
    for i in {1..20}; do curl -v -d @body.txt -H "Expect:" -X PUT "http://localhost:8923/?i=$i"; done
    ```

## Expected Behavior: Traffic Server 9.1.4

Under Traffic Server 9.1.4, all of the responses received back are the `413 Request Entity Too Large` error generated by the underlying nginx server. This is the expected behavior.

## Unexpected Behavior: Traffic Server 9.2.x

In both versions of Traffic Server 9.2.x, you'll sometimes get the expected `413 Request Entity Too Large` error back, but then a decent number of `502 Bad Gateway` errors will also be generated by the `nginx proxy` layer. The `nginx proxy` layer reports errors like the following (seemingly indicating that the connection to Traffic Server has been closed unexpectedly):

```
writev() failed (104: Connection reset by peer) while sending request to upstream, client: 172.27.0.1, server: , request: "PUT /?i=3 HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://172.27.0.5:8080/?i=3", host: "localhost:8922"
```
